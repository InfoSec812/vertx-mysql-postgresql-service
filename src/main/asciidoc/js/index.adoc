= Vert.x MySQL / PostgreSQL service

The `link:jsdoc/async_sql_service-AsyncSqlService.html[MySQL / PostgreSQL Service]` is responsible for providing an
interface for Vert.x applications that need to interact with a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

It uses Mauricio Linhares https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async[open source driver] to interact with the MySQL
or PostgreSQL databases in a non blocking way

== Setting up the service

As with other services you can use the service either by deploying it as a verticle somewhere on your network and
interacting with it over the event bus, either directly by sending messages, or using a service proxy, e.g.

Somewhere you deploy it:

[source,java]
----

// Deploy service - can be anywhere on your network
var config = {
  "host" : "mymysqldb.mycompany"
};
var options = {
  "config" : config
};

// Service name is "io.vertx:postgresql-service" if you want postgreSql
vertx.deployVerticle("io.vertx:mysql-service", options, function (res, res_err) {
  if ((res != null)) {
  } else {
  };
});

----

Now you can either send messages to it directly over the event bus, or you can create a proxy to the service
from wherever you are and just use that:

[source,java]
----
var AsyncSqlService = require("vertx-mysql-postgresql-js/async_sql_service");

var proxy = AsyncSqlService.createEventBusProxy(vertx, "vertx.mysql");

// Now do stuff with it:

proxy.getConnection(function (res, res_err) {
  if ((res != null)) {

    var connection = res;

    connection.query("SELECT * FROM some_table", function (res2, res2_err) {
      if ((res2 != null)) {

        var rs = res2;
        // Do something with results
      };
    });
  } else {
  };
});

----

Alternatively you can create an instance of the service directly and just use that locally:

[source,java]
----
var AsyncSqlService = require("vertx-mysql-postgresql-js/async_sql_service");

var config = {
  "host" : "mymysqldb.mycompany"
};

var mySqlService = AsyncSqlService.createMySqlService(vertx, config);

mySqlService.start(function (res, res_err) {
  if ((res != null)) {
  } else {
  };
});


----

If you create an instance this way you should make sure you start it with `link:jsdoc/async_sql_service-AsyncSqlService.html#start[start]`
before you use it.

However you do it, once you've got your service you can start using it.

== Getting a connection

Use `link:jsdoc/async_sql_service-AsyncSqlService.html#getConnection[getConnection]` to get a connection.

This will return the connection in the handler when one is ready from the pool.

* [source,java]
----

// Now do stuff with it:

service.getConnection(function (res, res_err) {
  if ((res != null)) {

    var connection = res;

    // Got a connection

  } else {
  };
});


----

Once you've finished with the connection make sure you close it afterwards.

The connection is an instance of `link:jsdoc/sql_connection-SqlConnection.html[SqlConnection]` which is a common interface used by
more than Vert.x sql service.

You can learn how to use it in the http://foobar[common sql interface] documentation.

== Configuration

Both the PostgreSql and MySql services take the same configuration:

----
{
  "address" : <event-bus-address-to-listen-on>,
  "host" : <your-host>,
  "port" : <your-port>,
  "maxPoolSize" : <maximum-number-of-open-connections>,
  "username" : <your-username>,
  "password" : <your-password>,
  "database" : <name-of-your-database>
}
----

`address`:: The address this service should register on the event bus. Defaults to `vertx.postgresql` or `vertx.mysql`.
`host`:: The host of the database. Defaults to `localhost`.
`port`:: The port of the database. Defaults to `5432` for PostgreSQL and `3306` for MySQL.
`maxPoolSize`:: The number of connections that may be kept open. Defaults to `10`.
`username`:: The username to connect to the database. Defaults to `postgres` for PostgreSQL and `root` for MySQL.
`password`:: The password to connect to the database. Default is not set, i.e. it uses no password.
`database`:: The name of the database you want to connect to. Defaults to `test`.

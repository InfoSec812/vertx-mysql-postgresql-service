/**
 * = Vert.x MySQL / PostgreSQL service
 *
 * The {@link io.vertx.ext.asyncsql.AsyncSqlService MySQL / PostgreSQL Service} is responsible for providing an
 * interface for Vert.x applications that need to interact with a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
 *
 * It uses Mauricio Linhares https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async[open source driver] to interact with the MySQL
 * or PostgreSQL databases in a non blocking way
 *
 * == Setting up the service
 *
 * As with other services you can use the service either by deploying it as a verticle somewhere on your network and
 * interacting with it over the event bus, either directly by sending messages, or using a service proxy, e.g.
 *
 * Somewhere you deploy it:
 *
 * [source,java]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.Examples#example1}
 * ----
 *
 * Now you can either send messages to it directly over the event bus, or you can create a proxy to the service
 * from wherever you are and just use that:
 *
 * [source,java]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.Examples#example2}
 * ----
 *
 * Alternatively you can create an instance of the service directly and just use that locally:
 *
 * [source,java]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.Examples#example3}
 * ----
 *
 * If you create an instance this way you should make sure you start it with {@link io.vertx.ext.asyncsql.AsyncSqlService#start(io.vertx.core.Handler)}
 * before you use it.
 *
 * However you do it, once you've got your service you can start using it.
 *
 * == Getting a connection
 *
 * Use {@link io.vertx.ext.asyncsql.AsyncSqlService#getConnection(io.vertx.core.Handler)} to get a connection.
 *
 * This will return the connection in the handler when one is ready from the pool.
 *
 * * [source,java]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.Examples#example4}
 * ----
 *
 * Once you've finished with the connection make sure you close it afterwards.
 *
 * The connection is an instance of {@link io.vertx.ext.sql.SqlConnection} which is a common interface used by
 * more than Vert.x sql service.
 *
 * You can learn how to use it in the http://foobar[common sql interface] documentation.
 *
 * == Configuration
 *
 * Both the PostgreSql and MySql services take the same configuration:
 *
 * ----
 * {
 *   "address" : <event-bus-address-to-listen-on>,
 *   "host" : <your-host>,
 *   "port" : <your-port>,
 *   "maxPoolSize" : <maximum-number-of-open-connections>,
 *   "username" : <your-username>,
 *   "password" : <your-password>,
 *   "database" : <name-of-your-database>
 * }
 * ----
 *
 * `address`:: The address this service should register on the event bus. Defaults to `vertx.postgresql` or `vertx.mysql`.
 * `host`:: The host of the database. Defaults to `localhost`.
 * `port`:: The port of the database. Defaults to `5432` for PostgreSQL and `3306` for MySQL.
 * `maxPoolSize`:: The number of connections that may be kept open. Defaults to `10`.
 * `username`:: The username to connect to the database. Defaults to `postgres` for PostgreSQL and `root` for MySQL.
 * `password`:: The password to connect to the database. Default is not set, i.e. it uses no password.
 * `database`:: The name of the database you want to connect to. Defaults to `test`.
